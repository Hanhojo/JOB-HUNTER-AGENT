Hi there! To prepare a tailored company overview and interview prep guide, I’ll need a few details from you:

1. **Target level** (e.g., “entry”, “mid”, “senior”)  
2. **Desired position title** (e.g., “Software Engineer”, “Product Manager”)  
3. **Preferred location** (e.g., “New York, NY”, “London, UK”)  
4. **The full list of job postings** you’re considering (each with title, company name, description, requirements, etc.)  
5. **Your resume or key profile details**, including:
   - Tech stack and core skills  
   - Recent roles and dates  
   - Notable projects and achievements  
   - Industry/company preferences  
   - Remote flexibility, contract type, salary expectations  
   - Any keywords you want emphasized or avoided  

Once I have that information, I’ll produce the complete Markdown document with:  
- ## Company Overview  
- ## Mission and Values  
- ## Recent News or Changes  
- ## Role Context and Product Involvement  
- ## Likely Interview Topics  
- ## Suggested Questions to Ask  

Looking forward to your details so we can dive in!
