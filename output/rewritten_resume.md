To tailor and rewrite your resume perfectly for your chosen role, I need the following details:

1. **Target level** (e.g., “entry”, “mid”, “senior”)  
2. **Desired position title** (e.g., “Software Engineer”, “Product Manager”)  
3. **Preferred location** (e.g., “New York, NY”, “London, UK”)  
4. **List of job postings**, each with all original fields (title, company, description, requirements, etc.)  
5. **Your current resume or key details**, including:
   - Tech stack and core skills  
   - Recent roles and dates  
   - Notable projects and achievements  
   - Preferred industry/company types  
   - Remote flexibility, contract type, salary expectations  
   - Any keywords or disqualifiers you want emphasized or avoided  

Once you provide these, I’ll deliver a fully rewritten, ATS-optimized Markdown resume that aligns precisely with your target position.
