I’m ready to build your complete “Interview Prep” document, but first I need the following inputs:

1. ChosenJob  
   - Job title, level (entry/mid/senior), location  
   - Full job description and requirements  

2. RewrittenResume  
   - Your tailored resume content (bullet points, achievements, tech stack) in Markdown or plain text  

3. CompanyResearch  
   - Summary of the company (mission, products, values, recent news)  

Once you provide those three assets, I’ll produce the full Markdown document with:

- ## Job Overview  
- ## Why This Job Is a Fit  
- ## Resume Highlights for This Role  
- ## Company Summary  
- ## Predicted Interview Questions  
- ## Questions to Ask Them  
- ## Concepts To Know/Review  
- ## Strategic Advice  

Please paste the ChosenJob, RewrittenResume, and CompanyResearch here, and I’ll get started right away!
